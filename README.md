Within this project for my inventory app, the goal was to create a simple yet effective inventory application that provided a login screen, a tabe page for the inventory and having the ability to edit any information regarding the inventory.  The UI screens that were necessary was the data table where all the inventory was sorted and by providing a simple login menu where you can create a new user to the app to make the ease of control better.  Keeping a simple flow within the app and not having buttons and actions everywhere on the screen so that it was easy on the users eyes and just flowed on the screen giving it the professional look I was aiming for.  Coding the app I took in baby steps as its not my strongest suite and I acquired outside help with tutorials and videos to help me understand what was needed from me.  testing the code was simple as if there were errors within the build you could analyze them and execute them to make it generate on the emulator.  Overall great project and learned a good amount of information that I didnt know before.
